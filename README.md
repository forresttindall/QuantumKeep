## QuantumKeep is a free, open-source file encryption application that uses quantum randomness for enhanced security ##

## The application provides local-only file encryption with true random encryption keys generated from quantum zero-point energy.##



## Features

**Quantum Random Key Generation:** - Uses genuine quantum measurements for true random encryption keys

**Local-Only Encryption:** - All encryption/decryption happens in your browser - data never leaves your device

**Zero Server Storage:** - No files or encryption keys are stored on servers

**AES-256 Encryption:** - Secure encryption with quantum-generated keys

**Multi-Platform Support:** - Works across all modern browsers and devices

**User-Friendly Interface:** - Simple drag-and-drop interface for file encryption/decryption


## Tech Stack

React.js - 
CryptoJS for AES-256 encryption - 
Quantum random number generation - 
Framer Motion for animations - 
React Router for navigation - 


## How It Works

Key Generation: When encrypting a file, the application fetches true random numbers from the ANU Quantum Random Numbers API
Encryption: Files are encrypted locally using AES-256 with quantum-generated keys
Local Processing: All encryption/decryption happens in your browser - no data is ever transmitted to servers
Secure Storage: Users receive an encryption key that must be saved to later decrypt their files
